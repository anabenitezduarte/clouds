	<p2>Cirrus clouds are the thin, wispy clouds seen high in the sky.
	They look as if someone took a cloud, stretched it, pulling pieces off,
	like a cotton ball when it is pulled apart. They are thin because they are made
	 of ice crystals instead of water droplets. A blue sky and a few cirrus clouds
	 high in the sky, usually means it is going to be a nice day.

The three main types of high clouds are cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus.
Cirrus clouds are wispy, feathery, and composed entirely of ice crystals.

	<h3>Cirrus</h3>
	<p3>
		Cirrus clouds are detached clouds in the form of white, delicate filaments,
		mostly white patches or narrow bands. They may have a fibrous (hair-like) and/or
		silky sheen appearance. They are always composed of ice crystals, and their transparent
		character depends upon the degree of separation of the crystals. As a rule, when these
		clouds cross the sunâ€™s disk they hardly diminish its brightness. When they are
		exceptionally thick they may veil its light and obliterate its contour.

Before sunrise and after sunset, cirrus is often colored bright yellow or red.
These clouds are lit up long before other clouds and fade out much later;
some time after sunset they become gray. At all hours of the day Cirrus near the
 horizon is often of a yellowish color; this is due to distance and to the great
 thickness of air traversed by the rays of light.
</p3>
	<h4>Cirrocumulus</h4>
	<p3>
		Transparent, whitish veil clouds with a fibrous (hair-like) or smooth appearance.
		A sheet of cirrostratus which is very extensive, nearly always ends by covering the
		whole sky.During the day, when the sun is sufficiently high above the horizon,
		the sheet is never thick enough to prevent shadows of objects on the ground.

A milky veil of fog (or thin Stratus) is distinguished from a veil of Cirrostratus
of a similar appearance by the halo phenomena which the sun or the moon nearly always
produces in a layer of Cirrostratus.
