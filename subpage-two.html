      All clouds have a distinctive look and shape to them, which is how we define them.
      The cumulus definition for cumulus clouds is clouds that have a flat based along with “fluffy” or
      “cotton candy-like” structures. The cumulus definition is rooted in the Latin word “cumulo” that
      translates to “pile” or “heap”. This makes sense seeing as cumulus clouds look like heaps of fluff.
      The two main types of cumulus clouds are cumulus and cumulonimbus.
   </p>
<h3>Cumulus</h3>
<p>
  Detached, generally dense clouds and with sharp outlines that develop vertically in the form of rising
  mounds, domes or towers with bulging upper parts often resembling a cauliflower. The sunlit parts of
  these clouds are mostly brilliant white while their bases are relatively dark and horizontal.

Over land cumulus develops on days of clear skies, and is due diurnal convection; it appears in the morning,
rows, and then more or less dissolves again toward evening.
</p>
<h4>Altocumulus</h4>
<p>
  Altocumulus clouds exhibit “cumulo” type characteristics (see below) in mid levels, i.e.,
  heap-like clouds with convective elements. Like cirrocumulus, altocumulus may align in rows or streets
   of clouds, with cloud axes indicating localized areas of ascending, moist air, and clear zones between
   rows suggesting locally descending, drier air. Altocumulus clouds with some vertical extent may denote
   the presence of elevated instability, especially in the morning, which could become boundary-layer based
   and be released into deep convection during the afternoon or evening.
</p>
<h5>Cirrocumulus</h5>
<p>
  Thin, white patch, sheet, or layered of clouds without shading. They are composed of very
   small elements in the form of more or less regularly arranged grains or ripples.Most of these elements
   have an apparent width of less than one degree (approximately width of the little finger at arm’s length).

In general, Cirrocumulus represents a degraded state of cirrus and cirrostratus, both of which may
change into it and is an uncommon cloud. There will be a connection with cirrus or cirrostratus and will
show some characteristics of ice crystal clouds.
